- **When ?** : July 18 to July 26 2018
- **Who ?** : [Deruwez Guillaume](https://github.com/gderuwez)
- **The app** : [The site is here](https://vast-tor-31473.herokuapp.com/)

## Specifications :
-Creation of a simple to do list using two different technologies.
-The initial app was created solely in php.
-The second version incorporate elements of javascripts and the code can be consulted on the branch "bonus"

## Our difficulties :
-Creating the app in php taught me the limitation of the language, the constant need to reload the page as well as the lack of dynamic asynchrone response made what should have been a simple and quick exercice into a complex task with severly complex logic that relies on constant checking checkbox initial and current states.
-The second version of the app, using javascript, proved much easier to implement with a far simplified logic.

## Modules, Libraries or frameworks used:
-[php](http://php.net/)\
-[jquery](https://jquery.com/)
